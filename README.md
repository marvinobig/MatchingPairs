# MatchingPairs Game

A simple **Memory Matching Game** built with **C# and Windows Forms**.  
The player flips two cards (icons) at a time and tries to find all matching pairs.

## Gameplay Overview

- The game board is a grid of hidden icons.  
- Each icon appears exactly **twice** on the board.  
- When you click on a square:
  - The first click reveals one icon.
  - The second click reveals another.
- If both icons match — they stay visible.  
- If not — they are hidden again after a short delay.  
- The game continues until all icons are matched.
